# [13:00 - 14:00] Redesign the UI
- The FletUI is great, it looks great, but it's not fully integrated
- Transferring state between pages is not supported for example
- I choose to get back to the tkinter, as it's the most popular framework for Python UIs
- Furthermore, tkinter is pre-installed on Python and can easily be upgraded
- To enhance its look, I used ttk-bootstrap

# [14:00 - 15:00] Reading the docs
- I don't really rely on ChatGPT for UI design, as it is rather imprecise
- Therefore, I ended up reading the docs for ttk bootstrap and some example of tkinter
- I ended up designing a mockup of my UI on paper

# [15:00 - 22:00] Implementing the UI
- Implementing the first rough UI outline
- It is now data-first instead of user-first, which means its primary goal is to display data, rather than being user-friendly
- The first prototype is working
- tkinter gives a much better oversight of the project than Flet
- So long I think this was a good decision
