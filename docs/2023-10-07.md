# [15:00 - 16:00] Adding the seven smaller projects
- Added a very rough outline of the seven smaller projects using ChatGPT
- Found a new framework called [Flet](https://flet.dev/) that looks better than tkinter
- Flet is based on Flutter, which makes it both versatile and good-looking
- I think I will use that going from now on

# [16:00 - 17:00] Setting up GitLab
- I set up GitLab to sync with my laptop using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- I wrote down all the progress I had already made till now in the docs folder
