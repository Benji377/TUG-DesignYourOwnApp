# [17:00 - 18:30] Starting model reimplementation
- I started reworking the machine learning model I created for predicting the temperature
- The previous one was limiting the accuracy
- The new one was implemented from scratch

# [20:30 - 23:30] Finished first model tests
- The new model now has an average accuracy of +/- 0.4Â°C
- It can be even more optimized with more data and better parameters
- The model has been added to the project and tested out
- It seems to work fine for now, much better than the previous one
