# [14:00 - 19:00] Refactoring and failed sync attempt
- I finished refactoring the application in different classes
- Having different classes makes organization easier
- Text size and color has been standardized
- I also attempted synchronizing the API data with the UI, but it failed
  - The UI is too complex and I can't figure out how to update it
  - Will try later again
