# [10:00 - 13:00] Reimplementing the UI
I reimplemented the entire UI in Tkinter.
Tkinter is included in the standard Python library which I am already familiar with.
Tkinter is not very good-looking, in fact I would say it's quite the opposite, but its ok for a first prototype.
I was able to create the entire layout I wanted using tkinter and was now looking for better frameworks to enhance the looks of tkinter.
Some options would be:
- ttkbootstrap: https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap
- CustomTkinter: https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter
