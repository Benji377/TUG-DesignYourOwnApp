# [15:00 - 17:00] Collecting weather data
I wanted to create my own neural network for predicting the weather, specifically the temperature.
To accomplish this, I started by searching for some weather data from the city of Graz.
Unfortunately I didn't find anything, so I had to collect the data from various websites and put them together.
I published my data on Kaggle for others to use: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benben377/weather-data-graz

# [19:00 - 20:00] Creating a small neural network
With the help of a couple YouTube videos, I created my own small neural network.
My code is heavily inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgX0Iz4q0bE)
I again published it on Kaggle for others to use it too: https://www.kaggle.com/code/benben377/weather-forecasting
The model can be saved as a pickle file and is therefore reusable in my Python code.
It has not been fully tested yet, I plan to do that later.
