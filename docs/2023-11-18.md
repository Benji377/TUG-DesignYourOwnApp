# [14:00 - 15:00] Exploring docstring concept
- I learned about docstrings in Python
- Mainly I focused on how to use them and what benefit they have
- I also learned about the different types of docstrings

# [15:00 - 17:00] Adding docstrings to my code
- I checked all my code and added docstrings to all functions
- Used GitHub Copilot to help me with the docstrings
- The format has been tested using pdoc3

# [17:00 - 19:00] Implementing pdoc3
- After testing other docs generators, I decided to use pdoc3
- pdoc3 is simple and minimalistic, which is what enough for this project
- After some tinkering, I managed to get it to work
- Furthermore, I added a script to generate the docs automatically

# [19:00 - 20:00] Final additions
- I checked that the app was still working
- Then I rewrote the README to make it more clear (https://chat.openai.com/share/7357edf4-27fd-4c58-b526-3fab435167f5)
- Finally, I generated the docs and pushed them to GitLab
