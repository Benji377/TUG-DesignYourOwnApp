# [17:00 - 18:00] Setting up Sourcery
Sourcery is a tool that enhances your code by giving suggestions on how to make it more compact and readable.
It is free for open source projects, and you can sign up with your GitHub account.
You can find it at https://sourcery.ai/.

# [18:00 - 23:00] Adding Tests and Refactoring
I added tests for the weather_api using Sourcery, then refactored the code to make it more readable.
I also added a new page for the weather forecast, and added a button to navigate to it from the main page.
Furthermore, I added some settings, allowing the user to change the temperature unit and download the data as a JSON file.
