# [14:00 - 16:00] First prototype
I started out by reading the curses documentation in Python, but I quickly discovered that it was not fully compatible with Windows.
I therefore moved to a different framework. Especially considering:
- Blessed: https://github.com/chjj/blessed
- py_cui: https://github.com/jwlodek/py_cui
- urwid: https://github.com/urwid/urwid

I ended up using Blessed because of its simplicity, nice design and compatibility.

# [16:00 - 17:00] Designing the interface
Now that I knew which library to use, I started by designing the application on paper.
This especially helped me to organize the structure of the application and figure out what type of layout to use.

# [17:00 - 00:00] Implementing the UI
While implementing the UI, I struggled a lot to get the components in the right place.
The CLI looked buggy, some elements were missing, not updating or just looking out of place.
After a lot of time, I finally had a general structure and was feeling confident to make small modifications.
I used placeholder for the data till now. So I started by replacing the very small unicode icons with ascii art.
That's where I found my first issue: ascii art is not resizable, making the UI in the CLI unresponsive and ugly.
After a couple mor hours of trying, I finally gave up on the idea of creating a CLI-only UI using curses.
