# Conditional Statements Project

This Python exercise focuses on understanding and using conditionals. Conditionals allow your programs to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on specified conditions.

## Functions:

### 1. `check_even_odd(number)`
   Determines if a number is even or odd.

### 2. `find_largest_number(a, b, c)`
   Finds the largest number among three given numbers.

### 3. `check_grade(score)`
   Assigns grades based on the given score.

## Tests:

The `test_main.py` file contains pytest tests for the functions in `main.py`. These tests ensure that the functions work correctly under different conditions.
