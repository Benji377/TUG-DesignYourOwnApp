# Collections Project

This Python exercise focuses on understanding and using different collections in Python: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Collections allow you to store multiple items, making them essential in programming.

## Functions:

### 1. `manipulate_list(input_list)`
   Modifies a list by adding an element and removing a specific element.

### 2. `process_tuple(input_tuple)`
   Converts a tuple to a list, modifies the list, and converts it back to a tuple.

### 3. `manipulate_set(input_set)`
   Modifies a set by adding and removing elements.

### 4. `process_dictionary(input_dict)`
   Adds a new key-value pair and removes an existing key-value pair from a dictionary.

## Tests:

The `test_main.py` file contains pytest tests for the functions in `main.py`. These tests validate the functionality of the collection-related functions.
