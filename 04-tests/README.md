# Automatic Tests Project

This Python exercise focuses on writing tests using pytest, a popular testing framework in Python. In this exercise, you'll write tests to validate the functionality of functions.

## Functions:

### 1. `add_numbers(a, b)`
   Adds two numbers and returns the result.

### 2. `multiply_numbers(a, b)`
   Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

### 3. `check_palindrome(word)`
   Checks if a word is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

## Tests:

The `test_main.py` file contains pytest tests for the functions in `main.py`. These tests validate that the functions are working as expected.
