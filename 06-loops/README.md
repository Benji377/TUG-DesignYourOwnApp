# Loops Project

This Python exercise focuses on understanding and using different types of loops: `for` loops, `while` loops, and nested loops. Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, making them powerful constructs in programming.

## Functions:

### 1. `print_numbers_with_for_loop(n)`
   Prints numbers from 1 to n using a `for` loop.

### 2. `calculate_factorial_with_while_loop(n)`
   Calculates the factorial of a number using a `while` loop.

### 3. `generate_multiplication_table(n)`
   Generates a multiplication table for a given number using nested loops.

## Tests:

The `test_main.py` file contains pytest tests for the `calculate_factorial_with_while_loop` function in `main.py`. These tests validate the functionality of the `while` loop.
